# PRIM'O

> Real-time meritocratic recognition platform for SMEs.

PRIM'O is a B2B2C SaaS platform that enables real-time meritocratic recognition inside SMEs. Employers buy token packs via Stripe, then allocate tokens to employees on the spot when they observe good performance. Employees accumulate tokens and redeem them for partner vouchers (promo codes) through the integrated marketplace.

The platform supports four roles: **admin** (manages companies and the voucher catalogue), **employer** (distributes tokens to their team), **manager** (intermediate role that receives a token budget from the employer and redistributes it to their employees), and **employee** (earns and spends tokens).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A Stripe account (test mode)

### Environment setup

```bash
# Backend
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Frontend
cp client/.env.example client/.env
# Fill in VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
```

### Run with Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Run locally

```bash
# Backend — http://localhost:5000
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend — http://localhost:3000
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Tests

All test commands are run from the `server/` directory.

#### Unit tests — `npm test`

Runs 83 Jest tests against every service and middleware in isolation. Uses mocks — no running server or database needed. Executes in ~1.5 seconds.

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

#### Practical E2E tests — `npm run test:e2e`

Runs 57 end-to-end scenarios against a live server, a real PostgreSQL database and Stripe in test mode. Covers the full application flow:

- Company creation and validation
- Employer, employee and admin registration
- JWT login, refresh and logout
- Token purchase with Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Stripe webhook processing (`payment_intent.succeeded`)
- Employer → employee token allocation
- Voucher creation, update and deletion (admin)
- Employee voucher redemption, balance deduction
- Role-based access control (401, 403, 402 error cases)

**Prerequisites:** Docker stack running + `server/.env` configured with valid Stripe test keys.

```bash
# 1. Start the stack
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Run the E2E tests
cd server
npm run test:e2e
```

Results are printed to the console and saved as `practical-test.md` at the project root.

## Architecture Overview

```
client ──(Axios + JWT)──► Express API (server/)
                              │
                 ┌────────────┼────────────┐
                 ▼            ▼            ▼
           PostgreSQL       Stripe       node-cron
           (Sequelize)   (webhooks +   (scheduled
                          subscriptions) allocations)
```

Every token movement (allocation, redemption, purchase) is wrapped in a **PostgreSQL transaction** so balances never drift out of sync. The cron job fires daily at 09:00 UTC to execute scheduled recurring allocations defined by employers and managers.

### Key flows

- **Token purchase:** employer subscribes to a plan (Stripe) → `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook → company token balance credited atomically.
- **Token allocation:** employer or manager transfers tokens to an employee — debits sender's balance, credits receiver's balance, records a `TokenTransaction` row, all in one DB transaction.
- **Voucher redemption:** employee spends tokens → balance debited, `Redemption` row inserted, promo code returned — all or nothing.
